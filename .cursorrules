# Portfolio Landing Workspace Cursor Rules

## Scope
- These rules apply to the entire Portfolio workspace (`/Users/chriswilson/Desktop/Business/Portfolio`). Add directory-specific overrides only when truly required.

## Product & Integrations Context
- Domain: Premium portfolio landing page + admin productivity dashboard showcasing multiple apps.
- Frontend stack: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind (style tokens defined in `tailwind.config.js` + `style-brief.json`).
- Data today: local placeholder JSON in `src/data/`. Upcoming: auto-ingest latest Vercel deployments + real business KPIs.
- Source of truth docs: `docs/portfolio-landing-prd.md` (requirements) and `style-brief.json` (visual system).

## Defaults for AI Actions
- Prefer absolute paths in tool calls and when referencing files in responses.
- Preserve existing formatting, spacing, and component structure; avoid formatting-only diffs.
- Keep edits surgical and scoped to the task. No refactors or dependency upgrades unless requested.
- Use clear, descriptive names; avoid 1–2 letter variables.
- Favor TypeScript strictness. No `any` unless absolutely unavoidable with explanation.
- Return early to limit nesting; keep components focused and composable.
- Write explanations succinctly; highlight what changed and why without fluff.

## Security & Compliance
- Never hardcode secrets or API tokens. Use environment variables (`.env.local`) for upcoming Vercel / analytics keys.
- Admin dashboard routes must remain gated once auth is introduced; never expose sensitive metrics client-side without safeguards.
- When mocking data, label it clearly so real credentials aren't mistaken for fixtures.

## Operational Conventions
- Frontend location: `frontend/`. Use feature folders under `src/components/` or `src/data/` per PRD (projects, dashboard, layout, etc.).
- Placeholder data lives in `src/data/*.ts`. Keep schemas aligned with future API responses to simplify the switch to live data.
- Images / media placeholders go in `public/mock/` with descriptive filenames.
- When adding build steps or scripts, document them in `frontend/README.md` (create if missing).
- Use `npm run lint` before handing off work; mention the result in updates.

## UI / UX Expectations
- Follow `style-brief.json` tokens (midnight palette, glowing gradients, stylized portraits). Maintain AA contrast.
- 8pt spacing system, rounded cards, premium glassmorphism overlays. Ensure hover/focus parity for keyboard users.
- Mock phone viewer should always have a graceful fallback state when assets are missing.
- Keep copy concise, action-led, and consistent with PRD tone.

## Data & API
- Defer to `docs/portfolio-landing-prd.md` for field requirements (project cards, KPIs, productivity score).
- When preparing for integrations (Vercel deployments, metrics APIs), stub TypeScript interfaces first and isolate fetch logic.
- Future API secrets belong in environment config; document any expected variables in `docs/setup` (create folder if absent).

## Status Tracking & Documentation
- Maintain `docs/Status.md` as the live task board:
  - Move items between Pending / In Progress / Completed as work evolves.
  - Update the `lastUpdated` value every time you edit the status file.
- Any feature-level change (new component, API, UX behavior) must be reflected in `docs/portfolio-landing-prd.md` before handoff so requirements stay accurate.

## Git & Changes
- Keep commits focused (e.g., `projects: add mock phone viewer`). Avoid mixing unrelated changes.
- Do not remove user-created files or restructure without explicit approval.

## Additional Rules

rule_type: always

---

Never use phrases like "Certainly!", "Of course!", or "Great question!". Respond directly without apologies or excessive politeness.

rule_type: always

---

Never hardcode secrets, credentials, or API keys in code. Use environment variables or secure config instead.

rule_type: always

---

Prioritize React/Next.js + TypeScript for frontend work and keep explanations concise.

rule_type: always

---

When editing code or docs, make minimal, surgical changes scoped to the feature or section at hand.

rule_type: always

---

Always update `docs/Status.md` when task states change and refresh `docs/portfolio-landing-prd.md` whenever feature scope shifts, so documentation stays synchronized with the implementation.
